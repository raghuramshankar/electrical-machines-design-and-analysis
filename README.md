## Design Assignment: Design of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine for Automotive Application

In this assignment, a reference machine geometry of a permanent magnet machine is provided to the students. 
Using the reference geometry and certain guidelines, we performed analysis and select parameters to complete the design.

The assignment involved four main tasks: 
- Magnetic circuit design
- Stator winding design
- Resistance and inductance calculation
- Load calculation

## Lab: Induction Machine Modelling and Operation

In this lab, we performed a practical experiment in order to determine the equivalent circuit parameters of an induction machine and acquire relevant quantities during a start-up.

The lab involved two tasks:
- Moodelled the induction machine in MATLAB, performed a simulation of the starting process of the induction machine and evaluated the simulated results with respect to the measured ones.
- Analyzed and predicted machine performance by using the learnt methods, models, procedures and formulae.
